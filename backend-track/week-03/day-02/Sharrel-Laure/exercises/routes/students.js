// points at a controller function. GET / and POST / are SOLVED. Uncomment the rest as
// you finish the matching controller function in controllers/students.js.

// ----- TODO Step 3: PUT /students/:id -----
router.put("/:id", studentsController.updateStudent);

// ----- TODO Step 4: DELETE /students/:id -----
